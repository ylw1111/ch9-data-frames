# Exercise 5: large data sets: Baby Name Popularity Over Time

# Read in the female baby names data file found in the `data` folder into a 
# variable called `names`. Remember to NOT treat the strings as factors!
names <- read.csv("~/Desktop/INFO201B/in-class/ch9-data-frames/exercise-5/data/female_names.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a data frame `names_2013` that contains only the rows for the year 2013
names_2013 <- data.frame(names[names$year == 2013, ], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?
names_2013 <- 

# Write a function `most_popular_in_year` that takes in a year as a value and 
# returns the most popular name in that year


# What was the most popular female name in 1994?


# Write a function `number_in_million` that takes in a name and a year, and 
# returns statistically how many babies out of 1 million born that year have 
# that name. 
# Hint: get the popularity percentage, and take that percentage out of 1 million.


# How many babies out of 1 million had the name 'Laura' in 1995?


# How many babies out of 1 million had your name in the year you were born?


## Consider: what does this tell you about how easy it is to identify you with 
## just your name and birth year?
